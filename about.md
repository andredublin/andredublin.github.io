Hello there its seems you have stumbled upon my corner of the internet.

First off a little about me, since you know, this is an about page...

* I am a software engineer ( duh! ).
* I used to be a chef ( sous chef that is ).
* I build for the web, mobile, and game platforms.
* I dabble in a variety of programming and scripting languages.
* I also dig network programming and distributed systems.
* I enjoy teaching and talking about programming and software architecture design to others.
* And learning something new.
